# Test-Repo

This is a repository of all my test codes

### Packages Tested
1. Pandas - for parsing datasets
2. Numpy - for math functions
3. Matplotlib - for plotting functions
4. requests - for api stuff
5. spotipy - for Spotify API stuff 

### Things to Remember
- API endpoints can be URLs, URIs, etc. 
- API is the system in which you interact with to access another program's data
